# Traffic Prediction Web Application

This web application predicts traffic conditions based on historical data using machine learning models. The app is built with **Streamlit** for the user interface, providing an easy-to-use and interactive experience. The prediction engine uses **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models to analyze traffic patterns and predict future traffic conditions.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Allows users to input parameters like time, day, and location to get traffic predictions.
- **Real-Time Traffic Prediction**: Provides predictions on traffic flow, congestion, and travel time using machine learning models.
- **Multiple Models**: Uses **Random Forest** and **SVM** to offer predictions and ensure accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and responsive user experience.
  
## How it Works
1. The user inputs parameters like the time of day, day of the week, and location.
2. The application preprocesses this data and feeds it into either the Random Forest or SVM model.
3. The models, trained on historical traffic data, predict the expected traffic conditions.
4. The results, including predicted traffic speed, congestion level, and expected travel time, are displayed on the interface.

## Requirements
- Python 
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## Machine Learning Models
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
- **SVM**: A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different traffic conditions.

## Conclusion
This traffic prediction web application is a tool for analyzing and forecasting traffic conditions.
